## About

Binaural is a sound app for [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org) designed for relaxation, focus, sleep, and meditation.

- Colored noise: white, pink, brown, and grey
- Ambient sounds
- Mix binaural beats, noise, and ambient sounds
- Sleep timer

## Download

The latest release is available on [OpenRepos.net](https://openrepos.net/content/molan/binaural)

## Audio Engine

The `AudioEngine` generates binaural beats in real time, sample-by-sample, using two sine waves: a fixed 200 Hz tone on the left channel and a slightly higher frequency on the right. The frequency difference creates the perceived binaural beat. The generated stereo 16-bit PCM audio is streamed through `QAudioOutput`, with the sample rate adapted to the audio device.

Colored noise is also generated in real time using a custom `ColoredNoiseGenerator` based on `QIODevice`. It supports White, Pink, Brown, and Grey noise using dedicated DSP algorithms, with per-noise-type gain calibration for a more balanced perceived loudness. The generated 16-bit PCM stream is played through `QAudioOutput`.

Ambient sounds are provided as audio files and played using `QMediaPlayer`. They can be combined with the binaural and colored-noise signals, with ambient sounds supporting fade-in, fade-out, and crossfading.
